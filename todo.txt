To add a visualization for a type:

1. Get the type signature for the type with IDebugSymbols->CreateTypeSignature
2. Create an IModelObject for the parent with IDataModelManager->CreateDataModelObject
3. Register the model for the signature with IDataModelManager->RegisterModelForTypeSignature
4. The model created needs to be a component implementation with IDataModelConcept

# Thread isolate
1. Add an parent on to Thread with a PropertyAccess for CurrentIsolate
2. In the accessor see if the V8 field for current TLS slot is available.
3. Try to retrieve the value in the slot.
4. If above is successful, return that pointer cast to a v8::internal::isolate
5. If not, return null.
6. See if it could then enumerate the scripts/heap/functions/etc. from it.

Try to figure out the best way to model the object hierarchy.

Try to create an 'enumerable' type on the map to show the slots on an object.
