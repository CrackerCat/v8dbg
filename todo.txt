# Clean up existing functionality
 x Handle Local<*> and MaybeLocal<*>
 x Handle SMIs
 - Handle v8::internal::Handle<*> & v8::internal::MaybeHandle<*>
 x Set the DisplayString
 - Use the dynamic property list, not the current hard-coded list
 - Try to handle JSObject and JSArray with an enumerator
 - Abstract away Address manipulation to handle pointer compression
 - Handle memory read failures
 - Support Linq expressions on object collections

# Thread isolate
1. Add an parent on to Thread with a PropertyAccess for CurrentIsolate
2. In the accessor see if the V8 field for current TLS slot is available.
3. Try to retrieve the value in the slot.
4. If above is successful, return that pointer cast to a v8::internal::isolate
5. If not, return null.
6. See if it could then enumerate the scripts/heap/functions/etc. from it.

# Misc
- Try to figure out the best way to model the object hierarchy.
- Try to create an 'enumerable' type on the map to show the slots on an object.
- Is it of use to show map transitions in some way?
